"# read-pdf" 
## This is a fork from <to-be-continued>.
  
I wanted to try it out, but I also used my previous project (start-new-project) to create the folder and repo so here we are.

I'll either update this when I get it working or delete it and fork the original project properly.

In the meantime, here it is. Feel free to try it out if you want.

You wll need:

```py
pip install PyPDF2
pip install pyttsx3
```
