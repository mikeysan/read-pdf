"# read-pdf" 
## This is technically a fork from [Python PDF Voice Reader](https://github.com/AquibPy/Python-Pdf-Voice-Reader).
  
I simply wanted to try it out without adding to it (except using my own sample PDF file). I also used my previous project (start-new-project) to create the working folder and repo so here we are.

**I'll either update this when I get it working or delete it and fork the original project properly.**

In the meantime, here it is. Feel free to try it out or link to the original and fork that - [Python PDF Voice Reader](https://github.com/AquibPy/Python-Pdf-Voice-Reader). I'd actually prefer if you use the original, to be honest. 
You wll need:

```py
pip install PyPDF2
pip install pyttsx3
```
